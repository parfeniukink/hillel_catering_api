> _Citizen Services & Government Analytics_

## Background...

You are designing a database for a **Government Citizen Services System**. This system helps track **citizen demographics, public services usage, infrastructure maintenance, and social programs**.

**The government wants to analyze:**

- **Demographic trends** (age, employment, education levels, etc.)
- **How citizens interact with government services**
- **Infrastructure maintenance efficiency**
- **Effectiveness of social programs**

## Task 1: Database Schema Design

Design a **relational database schema** that supports **citizen records, services, and infrastructure tracking**.

**Required Tables:**

1. **Citizens** (`citizens`) → Stores basic information like name, age, address, employment status, and education level.
2. **Public Services** (`public_services`) → Lists government services (e.g., healthcare, education, unemployment benefits).
3. **Service Usage** (`service_usage`) → Tracks which citizens use which services, when, and how often.
4. **Infrastructure** (`infrastructure`) → Stores public infrastructure (roads, schools, hospitals) and their maintenance history.
5. **Social Programs** (`social_programs`) → Tracks government programs (e.g., housing assistance, scholarships).
6. **Program Enrollment** (`program_enrollment`) → Records which citizens are enrolled in which programs.
7. **Government Employees** (`gov_employees`) → Tracks government workers managing services and infrastructure.

## **Task 2: Analytical Queries**
 
Write SQL queries to answer the following **government-related** questions:
P.S. I left some hints for you (｡◕‿‿◕｡)

1. Which public services are used the most?

```sql
SELECT ps.name AS service_name, COUNT(su.id) AS usage_count
FROM service_usage su
???
???
```

2. Which age groups benefit the most from government services?

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN age BETWEEN 0 AND 17 THEN '0-17'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 35 THEN '18-35'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 36 AND 50 THEN '36-50'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 51 AND 65 THEN '51-65'
        ELSE '65+'
    END AS age_group,
    COUNT(???) AS service_usage_count
FROM citizens c
JOIN ???
GROUP BY ???
ORDER BY ???
```

3. Which social programs have the highest participation?

```sql
SELECT sp.name AS program_name, COUNT(???) AS ???
FROM program_enrollment pe
JOIN ???
GROUP BY sp.name
ORDER BY ???
LIMIT 5;
```

4. Which government employees handle the most service requests?

```sql
SELECT ge.name AS employee_name, COUNT(???) AS requests_handled
???
GROUP BY ge.name
ORDER BY ???
LIMIT 5;
```

5. Which infrastructure projects are overdue for maintenance? (_OPTIONAL_)

```sql
SELECT i.name AS infrastructure_name, i.last_maintenance_date, i.scheduled_maintenance_date
FROM infrastructure i
WHERE i.scheduled_maintenance_date < CURRENT_DATE
AND ???
ORDER BY ??? ASC
```

# **Extra Challenge (Indexes & Optimization)**

- **Index the `service_usage` and `program_enrollment` tables** for faster citizen lookup.
- **Create a materialized view** to track monthly service usage trends.
- **Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to optimize queries for large citizen datasets.**
