> P.S. Since Django has a philosophy to separate models (aka db tables) into separate files.
> Because of that reason, Junior developers create as many apps as many models they have.
> This is actually not a good way to do that. Now, try to think about all your tables.
> If you would need to group them into logical layers, which would you do?
> Some of your models have similar 'concepts' so probably they could be kept at the same file.
